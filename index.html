<a id="welcome-to-my-github-page" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-my-github-page" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my GitHub Page.</h3>

<p>In this page I hope to gather my thoughts on the projects and code that I find interesting. My hopes are to spark ideas and create code that might be useful for others trying to solve the same problems I am interested in. If you seen anything here that you'd like to discuss, let me know at djcsdjcs at gmail.com.</p>

<p>Below are some of the projects I am working on.</p>

<a id="computer-vision-whiteboard-diagrams" class="anchor" href="#computer-vision-whiteboard-diagrams" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computer Vision: Whiteboard Diagrams</h3>

<p>I want to be able to pull out my phone after a design session and take a snapshot of the whiteboard and it automatically creates a nice rendered diagram that I can edit. Wouldn't it be cool if you could just write UML on a whiteboard and all the classes you drew would be created? OK that's taking things a little too far, but I think this would still be a cool project. It's pretty involved. A few people at CMU have written a paper on this. I need to take these papers and create useful code in OpenCV or something.</p>

<h3>
<a id="computer-vision-facial-recognition" class="anchor" href="#computer-vision-facial-recognition" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computer Vision: Facial Recognition</h3>

<p>There is a new coffee maker at my work [LINK], and it has a nice touch screen where you can customize your cup of coffee. I thought the whole thing wasn't fancy enough so I want it to recognize my face and "just know" what I want. In fact can it even tell the amount of caffeine I should need just by looking at my face? That would be fun.</p>

<h3>
<a id="productivity-task-oriented-uis" class="anchor" href="#productivity-task-oriented-uis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Productivity: Task Oriented UIs</h3>

<p>I have noticed patterns in the way that I work after many years of writing software. I tend to use virtual desktops to separate my tasks where all the related applications for that task are in one place. The modern OSes make managing these virtual desktops more than a little clunky. I want something like Macintosh's Mission Control but a much richer task-allocation features. I also would like for the computer to keep track of my time spent while working in each of these task spaces and maybe even record my activities. I will create a design doc for this soon.</p>

<a id="utilities-chicago-transit-apis" class="anchor" href="#utilities-chicago-transit-apis" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Utilities: Chicago Transit APIs</h3>

<p>I maintain a set of decorator classes that wrap the CTA APIs and makes them much nicer to work with. </p>
